## 03 – Variables & Primitive Data Types

In this chapter we lay the bedrock for every Python program:

* **Dynamic variables** – how Python binds names to objects at runtime.
* **Primitive data types** – `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `NoneType` and when to use each one.
* **Basic operators** – arithmetic, comparison and simple casting between types.
* **f‑strings** – Python’s modern, readable way to build formatted text.
* **Type‑introspection** – using `type()`, `isinstance()` and small debugging tricks.

Mastering these tiny building blocks early prevents countless bugs later, so take your time and make sure every concept feels intuitive before moving on.

## Chapter 05 ‚Äì Loops (for, while, range, and more)

In this chapter, we focus on **iteration and repetition** using Python loops.

You will learn:
- How and when to use `for` and `while` loops
- Working with `range()`, `break`, `continue`, and `else` with loops
- Nested loops and pattern generation
- Practical loop-based tasks like factorial, Fibonacci, and data scanning
- Short-circuit logic inside loops (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Challenges involving numbers, strings, and data simulation

We'll gradually go from **basic to advanced**, and end the chapter with a **Mini Project** to put everything together.

Digit '4' appears the most consecutively (4 times).
```
---
## Exercise 05-19 ‚Äì Check if Digits Are in Ascending or Descending Order (with loops)

**Description**  
This program asks the user to enter a number (as a string).  
Using a `for` loop, it checks whether the digits of the number are arranged in ascending, descending, or unordered sequence.

It compares each digit with the next one and keeps track of whether the sequence is strictly increasing or decreasing.

**Example**
```python
Enter a number: 123456
‚úÖ The digits are in ascending order.

Enter a number: 987321
‚úÖ The digits are in descending order.

It demonstrates the use of `for` loops for digit iteration and factorial calculation.

**Example:**
```python
Enter a number: 145
‚úÖ 145 is a Weird Number (1! + 4! + 5! = 145)

Enter a number: 123
‚ùå 123 is NOT a Weird Number (1! + 2! + 3! = 9)
```
---
## Exercise 05-21 ‚Äì Triple Repeat Finder (Loop & String Analysis)

**Description**  
This program receives a string from the user and checks if any character appears **exactly 3 times in a row**.  
If so, it prints those characters and the index where the triple repetition starts.  
If no such sequence exists, it informs the user accordingly.

**Example 1:**
```python
Enter a string: aaabbcccddde
‚úÖ Found: character 'a' repeats 3 times starting at index 0
‚úÖ Found: character 'c' repeats 3 times starting at index 5
‚úÖ Found: character 'd' repeats 3 times starting at index 8
```

**Example 2:**
```python
Enter a string: abcdefgh
‚ùå No character repeated exactly 3 times in a row.
```
---
## Exercise 05‚Äë22 ‚Äì Shifted Characters Using Unicode

**Description**  
This program prompts the user to enter a string.  
It then generates a new string where each character is shifted forward by one in the Unicode table.  
For example, `'a'` becomes `'b'`, `'Z'` becomes `'['`, and `'9'` becomes `':'`.

**Functions used:**
- `ord(char)` ‚Äì returns the Unicode code point of the character
- `chr(code)` ‚Äì returns the character represented by the Unicode code point

**Example:**
```python
Enter a string: abZ9*
Shifted string: bc[:+
```
---
## Exercise 05‚Äë23 ‚Äì Count Duplicate Letters (Case-Insensitive)

**Description**  
This program receives a string input from the user and finds all alphabetic characters (letters)  
that appear more than once, regardless of case (A/a treated the same).  
It prints how many times each repeated letter appears, along with the list of indices where they occur.

**Key Concepts:**
- `for` loop with `enumerate()`
- `dict` for counting and storing indices
- `str.casefold()` for case-insensitive comparison
- `str.isalpha()` to filter only letters

**Example:**
```python
Enter a string: ApPle is Amazing

Found repeated letters:
Letter 'a' appears 3 times at indices: [0, 10, 14]
Letter 'i' appears 2 times at indices: [6, 12]
```
---
## Exercise 05-24 ‚Äì Sum of Inner Digits (Excluding First and Last)

**Description**  
This program receives a number as input and calculates the sum of the digits **excluding the first and last** digit.  
If the number has fewer than 3 digits, it prints a warning.

**Example 1:**
```python
Enter a number: 52367
Sum: 12 (2 + 3 + 7)
```

**Example 2:**
```python
Enter a number: 81
Number must have at least 3 digits.
```
## Exercise 05-25 ‚Äì Detecting Consecutive Ascending Digits

**Description**  
This program prompts the user to enter a number (as a string).  
It then searches for a **sequence of at least 3 digits** that are in strictly increasing consecutive order.  
If such a sequence is found, it prints it. Otherwise, it informs the user that no such sequence exists.

**Example:**
```python
Enter a number: 245678
‚úÖ Found ascending number: 456

Enter a number: 987654
‚ùå No ascending digits were found.
```
---
## Exercise 05-26 ‚Äì Alternating Odd and Even Digits

**Description**  
This program checks whether the digits of a given number alternate between odd and even values.  
If any two consecutive digits are both odd or both even, the sequence is **not** considered alternating.

**Example:**
```python
Enter a number: 281739
‚úÖ Digits alternate between odd and even.

Enter a number: 1223
‚ùå Digits do not alternate.
```
---
## Exercise 05-27 ‚Äì Alternating Case Sequence

**Description**  
This program takes a string input from the user and checks whether the letters alternate between uppercase and lowercase.  
An alternating sequence is one where no two adjacent letters share the same case.

**How it works:**
- The user is prompted to enter a string (letters only, no spaces or numbers).
- The program checks that each letter has a different case than the one before.
- If all adjacent letters alternate in case, the input is considered valid.

**Example:**
```python
Input: AbCdEfG ‚Üí ‚úÖ Alternating case
Input: aBcDEfg ‚Üí ‚ùå Not alternating
Input: aBCd ‚Üí ‚ùå Not alternating
```

**Constraints:**
- Input must contain only alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z).
- Case sensitivity is enforced (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are treated differently).
---
## Exercise 05-28 ‚Äì Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description**  
This program takes a string as input and finds the longest substring without repeating characters using a loop-based approach.  
It uses a sliding window logic to check each possible segment and updates the longest substring accordingly.

**Example:**
```python
Enter a string: abcadefgb
‚úÖ Longest substring without repeating characters: bcadefg (length: 7)
```
---
## Exercise 05-29 ‚Äì Repeated Substrings (Length ‚â• 2)

**Description**  
This program takes a string input and identifies all substrings (length ‚â• 2)  
that occur more than once in the input string.  
It then prints each repeated substring along with the number of times it appears.

**How it works:**
- It uses nested `while` loops to generate all possible substrings.
- Only substrings of length 2 or more are tracked.
- The program uses a dictionary to count how many times each substring appears.
- Finally, it prints only those substrings that appear more than once.

**Example:**
```python
Enter a string: ababcabc
Found repeated substrings:
'ab' ‚Üí 3 times
'ba' ‚Üí 2 times
'abc' ‚Üí 2 times
'bca' ‚Üí 2 times
```

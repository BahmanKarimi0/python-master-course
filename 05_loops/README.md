## Chapter 05 ‚Äì Loops (for, while, range, and more)

In this chapter, we focus on **iteration and repetition** using Python loops.

You will learn:
- How and when to use `for` and `while` loops
- Working with `range()`, `break`, `continue`, and `else` with loops
- Nested loops and pattern generation
- Practical loop-based tasks like factorial, Fibonacci, and data scanning
- Short-circuit logic inside loops (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Challenges involving numbers, strings, and data simulation

We'll gradually go from **basic to advanced**, and end the chapter with a **Mini Project** to put everything together.

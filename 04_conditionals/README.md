## ðŸ§  Chapter 04 â€“ Conditional Statements in Python

This chapter introduces one of the most fundamental tools in programming: **decision-making**.

> Conditions allow your program to **choose different paths** based on input, values, or logic.

### ðŸ’¡ What You'll Learn:

- Basic structure: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Combining conditions with logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Truthy and Falsy values and how Python interprets them
- One-line conditionals using **ternary expressions**
- Nested `if` statements and clean formatting
- Membership (`in`) and identity (`is`) in conditions
- Common pitfalls and syntax mistakes (e.g., `=` vs `==`)
- Real-world mini-projects to test your understanding

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal of this chapter:
By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to write **smart, flexible, and readable code** that reacts intelligently to different situations and data inputs.

Each exercise is carefully designed to build your confidence step-by-step â€” from basic conditions to more complex decision structures.

> Start slow, think logically, and donâ€™t rush. This chapter is not about speed â€” itâ€™s about learning to **think like a developer**.
